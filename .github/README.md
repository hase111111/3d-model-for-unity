A repository for distributing assets of 3D models created for Unity.

## Theme

Unlock the vault to a world of creativity!

CarryVault is a Unity package designed for distributing 3D models with a twist of fun.
This package offers low-poly, vibrant models perfect for a variety of themes including fantasy realms, robot companions, and ancient ruins.

With built-in animations, it's never been easier to bring your scenes to life.
Whether you're building a whimsical world or an epic adventure, CarryVault is here to carry your ideas to the next level.

## Overview

In the course of creating games, I had hoped to someday distribute all the 3D models I had created, but it was difficult to do so because I didn't know where to distribute them, ~~and it was too much trouble to begin with~~.
However, I learned that UPM (Unity Package Manager) makes it easy to distribute assets, so I created this repository.

Since many of the models were created while studying Blender, I cannot guarantee the quality, but I have set the terms of use relatively loosely, so please feel free to use them.

Since many of the models are low-poly, they have low rendering load and can be applied to various scenes.
If you want to combine them with other assets, I think you'll find that the atmosphere matches well if you look for other low-poly assets.
